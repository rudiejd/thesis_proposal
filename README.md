This is my thesis proposal for Miami University. 

# Dependencies

- LaTeX. I used [TeX Live](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TeX_Live) to write it.
- Various LaTeX add-ons. In archlinux, I installed `texlive-latexrecommended` and `texlive-latexextra`
- Optional: A LaTeX language server for easier writing / autocomplete / navigation. I use [texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab)

# Building
I use the following commands:

```bash
pdflatex Thesis.tex
```

A combined `Thesis.pdf` containing all chapters should be written.
