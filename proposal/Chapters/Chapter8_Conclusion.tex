\chapter{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
In summary, PC2L will be a C++ framework that provides standard, distributed data structures comparable to those found in the C++ STL. Through exploration of numerous alternative libraries that attempt to achieve this goal, we extracted many contributions in the form of useful constructs and design patterns. We listed and justified the initial set of data structures that will be implemented in PC2L. We provided a description of the underlying concepts common to each of these data structures. We provided a timeline for the development of PC2L, stopping criteria for finishing work on PC2L, and evaluation criteria for demonstrating the usefulness of the library.
