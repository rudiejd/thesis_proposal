\section{Motivation}

\section{Contributions}
This thesis will make the following contributions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item an improved C++ memory allocator designed for effictively utilizing big memory
        \item modular distributed data structures that can easily be inserted into existing programs with little change in code complexity and a resultant increase in performance
            \begin{itemize}
                \item vector
                \item unordered multi-map
                \item heap
            \end{itemize}
        \item garbage collector designed for memory hungry programs running on distributed systems
    \end{itemize}
